# Appointment Manager
### Reason for creating:
I created this application for Software II at Western Governors University.

### What does it do?
It allows users to keep track of customer information and appointments. A user may add, modify, or delete customers or appointments from the system. 
The user interacts with the application through a graphical user interface. Users can request a variety of reports concerning upcoming schedules for consultants.
The application uses an SQlite database for persistent memory.
### How to run the application:
* Ensure you have java version 1.8.0_251 or higher
* Download the "Dist" file to your computer
* Open "Dist" file and double click on "Appointment_Manager.jar" file to execute it.

I have also included the source code and configuration files from NetBeans. I used Netbeans version 8.2 and JavaFX Scene Builder 2.0 to create the application. 
You're welcome to download these files and modify them for your personal use.
